## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- **SQL Server** → Data cleaning, transformations, queries.
- **Power BI** → Dashboard design, KPI tracking, interactive visualizations.
- **Excel** → Initial validation & preprocessing.
- **Data Analysis** → Business insights & recommendations.

---

## 🔹 Approach
1. **SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis**
   - Imported raw CSV into SQL Server.
   - Cleaned and standardized data (dates, nulls, duplicates).
   - Wrote queries to calculate:
     - Loan approval rates
     - Monthly loan applications
     - Loan purpose distribution
     - Default/charge-off rates
   - Matched SQL outputs with Power BI dashboards to validate results.

2. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - KPIs: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Received Amount, Interest Rate, DTI(Debt to Income) Rate.
   - Charts:
     - Loan Status Distribution
     - Loan Purpose Analysis
     - Borrower Demographics (income, home ownership, employment length)
     - Monthly Loan Trends
   - Interactive filters for state, loan purpose, and loan grade.

## 📌 Key Insights

✅ 86.2% loans are good, while 13.8% are bad (charged-off).

📉 60-month loans have higher default rates compared to 36-month loans.

💰 Debt consolidation is the most common loan purpose (~18K loans) but also carries the highest default risk.

📊 Charged-off loans carry higher average interest rates (15.1%), while fully paid loans average 11.6%.

🏡 Borrowers who own homes are the safest, while renters/mortgage holders are riskier.

📅 Loan applications peak in Nov–Dec, indicating seasonal borrowing patterns

💰 **Debt consolidation** and **personal loans** were most common.

🏡 Loan applications showed seasonality with peaks in specific months.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Apply stricter credit checks for Grades E, F, G and 60-month loans.

- Encourage borrowers to opt for 36-month loans with slightly lower rates.

- Focus marketing efforts on stable borrowers (homeowners, 10+ years of employment).

- Create special loan products for debt consolidation with risk safeguards.

- Use predictive analytics to identify high DTI & high-interest applicants at risk of default.

- Adjust loan policies around seasonal peaks (Nov–Dec) to balance demand and risk

---

## 🔹 Business Impact
This analysis enables the bank to:
- Reduce **default risk** with better credit checks.
- Optimize **loan approval strategy** by focusing on reliable borrower segments.
- Plan **cash flows** by tracking seasonal loan demand.
